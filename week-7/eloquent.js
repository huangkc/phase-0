// Eloquent JavaScript

// Run this file in your terminal using
 // `node my_solution.js`. 
 // Make sure it works before moving on!

// Program Structure

// Write a short program that asks for a user to input 
// their favorite food. After they hit return, have the 
// program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" 
// (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console 
// rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). 
// Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.
// var anwer=prompt("What is your favorite food?");
// console.log("Hey! That is my favorite too!");

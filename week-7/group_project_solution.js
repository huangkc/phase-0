// Person 1

// As a user, I want to take two lists of numbers, one with 
// odd number of elements and the other with even number of elements, 
// and calculate the sum, mean, and median for each list.

// One function called "sum" should calculate the sum for list 1 and the 
// sum for list 2
// One function called "mean" should calculate the average (with decimal places)
// for list 1 and the average for list 2
// One function called "median" should calculate the median 
// (with decimal places) for list 1 and the median for list 2

// Example:
// list1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7
// list2: 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7
// The sum function should return 27 for list1 and 43 for list2.

//Initial solution

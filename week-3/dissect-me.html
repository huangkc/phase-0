What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
We used these tags

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8"/>
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
These tags are common to every HTML document.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements get laid out in a tree structure such as depicted in the Document Object Model. The browser displays the elements node by node, starting with <html> followed by <body> followed by the elements inside the <body>.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? 
Sublime has many tools, such as snippets, that one can use when writing HTML. 

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I will create more snippets and research more shortcuts in the future. This [site] (http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/) has helpful hints.

##1.1 Thinking About Time

I learned about time boxing, pomodoro technique, mindfulness meditation, and growth mindset. A time box is a predetermined period of time for working on a task. When the time limit has been reached, work is stopped to evaluate what has been accomplished. I find that with open-ended reflections it is helpful to set a time box so as to limit the scope of the task.

I usually review the list of things to do for the day, determine the amount of time needed to accomplish each task, and then plan each task around my schedule. My attention span varies from task to task and I don’t always get as much work done as efficiently as possible.

I will use the pomodoro technique to make time management more precise and systematic. This technique involves estimating how many 25 minute blocks are required to complete a task and then setting objectives around that timetable. I will also practice mindfulness meditation for relaxation, stability, and calmness. For Phase 0, I will prioritize tasks for the week and break them down to sub-tasks when possible. I will also track more closely the time spent on each task and define the scope of what is to be accomplished. 

##1.2 The Command Line

A shell is an interface for accessing a computer’s operating system using text commands. A bash is a UNIX shell that can process commands from a file. The most challenging aspect for me was keeping track of the different commands for LINUX and Windows and the amount of material that need to be memorized with little to no experience working on a command prompt. The most important commands and arguments to know are commands for manipulating files (display, copy, move etc.) and creating navigating through directories. 

-pwd  print working directory
-ls  list files/directories
-mv  move file/directory
-cd change directory
-../ go up one directory
-touch create an empty file
-mkdir  make directory
-less   view/display file
-rmdir remove directory
-rm remove file
-help find help on commands

##1.4 Forking and Cloning

To create a new repo: Click New Repository button on your Github profile page and name the new repo. Choose between creating a Public and a Private repo. Click Create Repository button.

To fork a repo: find the target repo on Github. Click Fork button and select your profile.  

To clone a repo: from Github - copy the clone URL from the fork. Open the command prompt. Type “git clone” followed by the clone URL you copied. Check the contents of the directory to make sure the repo has been copied to the local computer.

Forking creates a copy of the repository on the local computer so one can modify files in the repository. When changes are committed, a snapshot of the changes is made so they can be accessed at any time. I learned how forking allows developers to work with the files in the repository without affecting the original. Since forking preserves the connection to the master branch, changes can be incorporated into the master branch later. I also learned how Git and GitHub work together, how to create a new repository on GitHub, and how to use the command line to clone repositories.

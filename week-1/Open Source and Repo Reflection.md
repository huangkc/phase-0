## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on GitHub: click Create New Repository button at the top right hand corner. Name the repository, fill out the form, and click Create Repository. This creates a repository that lives on the Internet. 

To clone this repository: find the HTTPS clone URL on GitHub and copy the link. Open a command prompt and type “git clone” followed by the link you just copied. This will make a copy of the new repository on your computer. 

- Describe what open source means.

Open source software is computer software whose source code is freely distributed with a license. By sharing the source code, others can customize the program and modify its features for their purposes.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source software is beneficial for promoting collaborative development and innovation and may result in significant savings to consumers. Greater emphasis on technical requirements without commercial pressure could also lead to better quality. However, because open source software licenses may not restrict use by any person or group, there always exists the risk of open source software being used for illegal purposes. Open source software may also have more security vulnerabilities than proprietary software. These disadvantages should be weighed against the advantages.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

When developers release their work to the public domain without a license, they relinquish their copyright. Licensing allows developers to retain the original copyright while granting specific permissions or impose specific restrictions on what others may do with their work. Particularly with open source software, using licenses makes it easy to collaborate while protecting the original creator’s rights.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? 
What did you struggle with? 

This challenge solidified my understanding of how to create new repositories on GitHub and how to clone the repository onto my local computer. I struggled with pushing changes and creating and merging pull requests but I was able to get additional practice in this challenge. Through this practice I now have a better understanding of each step in pushing and merging changes.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found a lot of useful information here for understanding open sources software, open source licenses, and free software from the 
Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative.

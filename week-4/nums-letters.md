Release 1
What does puts do? Returns nil and prints to the console with a new line.

What is an integer? What is a float? 

An integer is a number without decimals. A float is a number with decimal points.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? Integer division returns the integer part of the answer. If the answer has decimals (a remainder), they will not be returned. Float division returns remainder, if any.

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Use "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, and "/" for division.

What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a number without decimals. A float is a number with decimal points.

What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division returns an integer part of the answer. If the answer has a remainder (decimals), they will not be returned. Float division returns the remainder, if any.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them? 
Strings are characters or groups of characters (or spaces). Strings are useful for holding, inputting, outputting, passing, or otherwise manipulating text.   

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables that are visible only within a limited scope in the program. We use local variables when we want to limit their accessibility. Variables that are global in scope could get changed by accident and that will cause the program to break. Using local variables can minimize this.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was good for re-introducing Ruby as I had forgotten a lot of what I learned prior to coming here. I got a good review of the basic concepts through the exercises and I got to practice the workflow and testing which was helpful for getting reaquainted with Ruby.

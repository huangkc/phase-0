# Largest Integer

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# largest_integer is a method that takes an array of integers as its input
# and returns the largest integer in the array
#
# +list_of_nums+ is an array of integers
# largest_integer(list_of_nums) should return the largest integer in the +list_of_nums+
#
# If +list_of_nums+ is empty the method should return nil

# Your Solution Below

# My initial solution was to iterate through the list and use <=> to compare each
# item to the next but I could not get the test to pass.

# def largest_integer(list_of_nums)
# 	list_of_nums.sort!
# 	list_of_nums.last
# end
